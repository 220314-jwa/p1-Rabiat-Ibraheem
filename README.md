# Java with Automation Foundations Project

##  STORY PITCH MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Story Pitch Management System is an application that allows authors to submit story pitches to a publishing company. Authors are allowed to submit a pitch that includes a brief description of the story they hope to write, a tentative title, an expected completion date and a specified genre. Editors are able to view the pitches and either approve or reject them based on how well they meet the company's standards. Editors are also able to leave comments/suggestions on approved, pending or rejected pitches.

## Technologies Used

Back-End: Java(1.8), Javalin(4.3.0), Maven(4.0)

Front-End:  HTML5, CSS(2.1), JAVASCRIPT(ES 12)

Database:  PostgreSQL(14.3), DBeaver(22.0.4)

Testing:  JUnit(5.8.2), Mockito(4.4.0), Selenium(3.17), Postman(9.18)

## Technical Requirements
1. Data must be stored and retrieved from a PostgreSQL database (local or AWS).
2. Data access in Java will be performed using JDBC DAOs.
3. HTTP handling in Java will be done using Javalin.
4. Service layers must be fully unit tested using JUnit and Mockito.
5. DAOs are fully unit tested using JUnit.
6. Front end must be written using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no libraries/frameworks for JS. Styling libraries like Bootstrap are fine).
7. At least one feature must have an automation test written using Selenium.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone the project. Open the client in Replit, VScode or any similar code editor of your choice. Open the backend in Eclipse IDE. The client is written in JavaScript, so you can use the client immediately by copy/pasting the path to index.js into your broswer search bar. The backend api is built with the Javalin framework, and so runs directly on your local machine (via the JVM). Simply run the file that has the main method, application.java.
